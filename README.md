Ready to float, dodge, and race your way to the stars? Introducing Bubble to the Moon, a high-flying, bubbly adventure created in just 48 hours by an awesome team during a Game Jam!

## âœ¨ The Story:

In a lively playground, kids challenge each other to an epic race: who can reach the moon the fastest using their bubbles? Play as quirky characters like Bubble Game Girl, Snot Boy, and more as you navigate through tricky obstacles and keep your bubble intact.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works:

Inflate and Deflate: Add air to rise, release to sinkâ€”but donâ€™t overinflate, or POP!
Move Side to Side: Weave through sharp objects and keep your bubble safe.
Stay in the Frame: Drift too far, and the race is over!

## ðŸŽµ What Makes It Special:

This exciting game design is brought to life by the creative minds of Yarden, Maor, and Polina, the smooth sounds from our talented sound designer, and the development magic of Liad and Idan. Together, weâ€™ve created a colorful, playful, and competitive journey thatâ€™s sure to make you smile.

Will your bubble be the one to reach the moon? Join the race and find out! ðŸš€ðŸŽˆ
